### This website is written using VueJs

As part of diversifying my skillset I learnt the Vue framework. I have created this website as a playground for trying out various Vue and other web development practices.

Some Vue concepts this website uses;

*   List rendering
*   Conditional rendering
*   Binding styles
*   Routing, 404 pages and redirect, meta fields and navigation guards
*   State management with the user themes being saved, using Pinia
*   Event handling
*   Input bindings
*   Loading of markdown files and using this as content for most of my pages

#### CSS

This website CSS is my work. The colour scheme was chosen by a section of the rust website.

### Tauri app with Vue

My first tutorial project with Vue was to create a fictional commerce store in Tauri. This program features asynchronous loading of data along with state management keeping a shopping cart.

### Static site generator with Hugo

My first job out of university was working for the networking team transferring data from a drupel site to markdown. The markdown data was along with a static site generator for their new website.

### University as part of my degree

As part of my bachelor's thesis I transferred a network analytics app to the web. Additionally I have completed various web assignments interacting with database using ajax along with serverside programming.
