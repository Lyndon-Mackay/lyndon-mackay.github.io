### C# at University

C# is the first programming language I learnt at university. I ended up using C# for the vast majority of my university assignments.

#### Glass subsystem 

Maintaining a program that converts vendor pricing data into ERP compatitable data and vice versa. 

#### A Calculator, with voice activation and sending browser history over network

As part of a job interview project I was tasked with making a calculator with our own unique twist. 
I came up with the idea of sharing history over the network.

#### MVC website

I made a similar website to this one with some, example SQL in order to learn MVC concepts.

### F#

After university I learnt F#. Initially this was to better understand LINQ as I did not have a great deal of experience with 
functional programming. I soon discovered how much I love the type system; I ended doing some daily programmer challenges to explore 
some more advanced programs.

#### Fsharp Worm Wars

A programming challenge I found on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/6hm5j2/20170616_challenge_319_hard_worm_wars_2_network/) This challenge is to write software that mimics a network that gets a virus and is patched. I wrote my solution using as much "point-free" style as I could.
