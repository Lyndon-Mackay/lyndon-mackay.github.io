###  Education


Bachelor's degree in Computer and Mathematical Sciences

### Experience

An experienced programmer especially in the context of maintaining an ERP system.<br>
I have programmed in many languages including C#, F#, Java, Rust, Javascript, Haskell and I am knowledgeable about business operations in a construction and warehousing context.<br>

### Qualities 


I am strongly driven to make systems as easy to use as possible. I constantly ask myself at every step in the interaction if the user is getting value from it.<br>
From a programming standpoint I like using data types in a way to architect code as neatly as I can.  My favourite adage in regards to programming is "Make illegal states unrepresentable"<br>
Of course strict deadlines may not make this possible but I have a habit of returning to make improvements.
