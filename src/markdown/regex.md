### Scanning through user presentable data

When users submit errors in their reports it can be located alongside some data in a consistent form but constantly changing in very large reports where you have a replicable source of errors a regular expression can be useful for jumping to the next error or helping confirm a solutions solves multiple errors

### Duplicating code changes

Sometimes lots of method calls need to be changed in a very large file or over a folder. Two major examples of this are

1.  Adding logging to lots of variable assignments for the so dev team can see which code is triggered
2.  Changing method calls to use a newly created replacement that takes different arguments. I needed to do this as logic was moved further ahead in the pipleline

VScode features a preview of the replacement result so changes can all be looked at before they are executed
