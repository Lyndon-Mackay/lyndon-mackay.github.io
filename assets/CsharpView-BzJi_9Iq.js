C# is the first progamming language I learnt at university. I ended up using C# for the vast majority of my university assignments

#### A Calculator, with voice activation and sending browser history over network

As part of a job interview project I was tasked with making a calculator with our own unique twist. 
I came up with the idea of sharing history over the network.

#### MVC website

I made a similar website to this one with some example SQL in order to learn MVC concepts

### F#

After university I learnt F# initially this was to better understand LINQ as I did not have a great deal of experience with 
functional programming. I soon discovered how much I love the type system I ended doing some daily programmer challanges to explore 
some more advanced programs

#### Fsharp Worm Wars

A programming challange I found on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/6hm5j2/20170616_challenge_319_hard_worm_wars_2_network/) This challange is to write software that mimmicks network that gets a virus and is patched. I wrote my solution using as much point free style as I could.
`,d=["innerHTML"],g=a({__name:"CsharpView",setup(h){const t=o(c).mkd;return(u,w)=>(m(),r(i,null,[e("h2",{style:s(n(l)("h2"))},"Some C# and .net projects",4),e("article",{id:"contents",innerHTML:n(t)},null,8,d)],64))}});export{g as default};
