I have five years of experience primarily helping maintain an ERP system
for a timber door company.
I learnt about the process of how a door is constructed
having walked around and observed the factory.
### Aluminium windows, doors, shower-screens and wardrobes
After closing all the actionable timber door support tickets, I started
assisting the fenestration side of the business.
Working on a large variety of products and helping streamline validation
for commonalities such as glass validation.
### ERP Systems
I have maintained many areas of an ERP system, including order-entry,
manufacturing bill of materials, pricing,labour systems and production
paperwork.
I have overhauled many systems, improved how updates are performed and
the way we undo changes by either implementing transactions (not
the default for that programming language) or outputting backups.`,l=["innerHTML"],g=t({__name:"ConstructionView",setup(u){const a=o(d).mkd;return(p,h)=>(m(),s(i,null,[e("h2",{style:r(n(c)("h2"))},"My experience with construction/ERP systems",4),e("article",{id:"contents",innerHTML:n(a)},null,8,l)],64))}});export{g as default};
